            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>From the moment I first stepped onto my yoga mat 4 years ago, I fell in love with it. Initially, 
            I only wanted to get physical benefits as I had been feeling a severe pain in my back and my shoulders at the time. 
            Yoga was an excellent way to gain flexibility and strength which then boosted my productivity and helped me keep the balance between my personal 
            and business life. But, as the time went by, I felt that my coordination, focus and memory capacity significantly improved. 
            I got less distracted by my own thoughts and more focused on the things I was working on. It gave me an inner strength and a peace of mind. 
            The experience was illuminating. The technological advancement has had an incredible impact on the way we live. On the one hand, 
            it has helped us become more efficient and more productive in our everyday life thus leading to better results. On the other hand, 
            it has caused us more stress and a lack of time. We easily get overwhelmed by the pressure we have to face on a daily basis. To make matters worse, 
            stress can take its toll physically, emotionally and mentally and can affect everything from sleep to our relationships with people that surround us.</p>
